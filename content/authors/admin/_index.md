My research interests falls in the intersection of multivariate statistics, social network analysis and computational social science. I like working interdisciplinary and doing research that moves across scientific borders. 

Statistical literacy is the hallmark of my research and teaching practise. In an age of emerging digital data sources and high-dimensional data sets, I consider it a public service to stay true to the backbone of statistics and perform theory driven analyses rather than data driven ones. In today's increasing data science applications, it is a common mistake to assume that the transferability of tools already carries with it the analogy of meaning. Therefore, I aim to integrate a combination of computational, statistical and disciplinary expertise in all aspects of my academic practice.

The projects that I have worked on and am currently working on are listed below.
